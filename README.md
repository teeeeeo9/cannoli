## Cannoli Finance

Cannoli Finance. Goes perfectly well with Espresso.

Cannoli is a platform that makes LPs dreams about earning yield on a token as if they were providing it to the pools on all networks come true. In short, Cannoli multiplies capital efficiency.

A sigle nitro rollup - the Liquidity hub - aceepts the liquidity, which earns yield on rollups connected to Espresso. Espresso serves as the source of confirmation that changes in liquidity occured on the Liquidity hub and confirmations of trades on connected rollups.
